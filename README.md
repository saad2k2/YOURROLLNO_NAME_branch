Merging pull request in GitHub feel good but also hard. Sometimes, many changes happen, and conflict come. Fixing conflict not easy, need careful check. When code not match, things break, and I must debug. Also, remembering project workflow important, or mistake happen. Sometimes, pull request not work good, and I need try again. This take time and make me tired. But after solving, I feel happy because project move forward. Even if difficult, I learn more every time. Working with GitHub like puzzle, must put pieces right. Hard but useful for team work.
